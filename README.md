## ❓ What Problem Does It Solve?

In most colleges, when a faculty member applies for leave, they must manually contact other teachers to arrange substitutions. This often leads to:

- ⏳ Wasted time calling or messaging multiple colleagues  
- ❌ Miscommunications or unavailability of substitutes  
- 📉 Unorganized timetables and missed classes  
- 📋 No centralized system to manage leave records or timetable updates  

**ScheduleX** solves this by:

✅ Automatically detecting which teachers are free during the requested slot  
✅ Sending instant substitution requests  
✅ Updating the class timetable on confirmation  
✅ Keeping a centralized record of leaves and class allocations  

> This ensures uninterrupted classes, reduces administrative burden, and increases overall scheduling efficiency.
